Brahma.js Testing Files
===================

These files are not meant for use outside of this project. They are testing files designed specifically for trying out code.
An example of this is the file https://github.com/parth-pandey2030/brahmajs/blob/master/assets/tests/_graphics.html,
which is strictly designed for trying out an HTML Canvas method. In fact, this is the reason that the files are named strating with a '_', so as
to distinguish which files are testing files and which files are not.
