# Brahmajs

Named after the Hindu God of Creation, Brahma.js is a framework for building and describing natural phenomena and creating new things.
It is designed to be easy to use, as, unlike Node.js or React.js, which use the ".js" suffix to show they are JS libraries, Brahma.js is an actual
JavaScript file, containing a myriad of data to allow developers to create many wondrous things, as only one reference to one file is needed to use all
of its potential.

It contains a framework for working with complex math, including differential and integral calculus. It also contains a framework for working with 
Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.

# Use
To use Brahma.js' capabilities, all you have to do is have an enviornment to run it, as Brahma.js supports both Node.js and other envs, including 
the browser. For example, for the the browser, you can do
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <script src = "Brahma.js"></script>
        <script>
            // Whatever you desire...
            // Make sure you do AI.what_you_want, as all methods are
            // exported in an "AI" object.
        </script>
        <p id = "test"></p>
        <button onclick = "document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = test()">test</button>
    </body>
</html>
```
